 * `instrumentation/development.java.*` values the selected agent version
 * doesn't have from the YAML output: the schema types `java` as a bare key_value_map, so the per-version
 * inventory is the only source of which names exist.
 *
 * general.* is excluded on purpose. Its validity comes from the (pinned)
 * config schema, and the inventory only mentions a handful of its leaves, so
 * allowlisting it here would delete fields the General card owns.
 *
 * Do not derive this from buildInstrumentationDefaultEntries: that skips
 * options with empty defaults, so a user-set value for such an option would be
 * missing from the allowlist and wrongly hidden.
